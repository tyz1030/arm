# first meeting Friday 09/14/2018

# Gripper design
- Thickness of 'gripper2' plates -- will they be strong enough?
- Could Gripper 2 plates be made from laser cut wood?
- Gripper 2 'rod'/ rivet -- steel or 3D printed material, ask Peter. 
- Do first print -- try and have a first mockup on Wednesday the 09/19/2018
- Approx gripper dimensions:
	- total length ~140mm
	- center offset ~10mm

# Cameras & Kinect
- Calibration with chessboard to find intrinsic matrix -- Done
- Matrix saved intrinsic matrix to csv instead of cfg
- Click points on image -- before or after undistortion? Think before, but check notes

# Teach & Repeat
- Works fine but jerky -- needs to be smoothed

# Kinematics
- choose end effector pose to be center of 'block' being gripped

 
ACTIONS for Wednesday 09/19/2018:
- Tianyi
	- send stl/ dimensions to Tom for kinematics 
	- First draft of printed Gripper
- Justin 
	- To work on mapping pixels to positions.
	- Integrate kinect and camera 
- Tom
	- 'Generate cubic spline' for smoothing trajectory
